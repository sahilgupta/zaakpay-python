The ZaakPay Python integration kit mainly consists of two files. checksum.py and zaakpay.wsgi

Make sure that you replace the secret key in checksum.py with your own.

zaakpay.wsgi has checksum.py as a requirement. So, you need to have checksum.py in the same 
directory or anywhere else in the PYTHONPATH.

Also, the ReturnURL configured on ZaakPay.com for the Merchant needs to be of the form "http://example.com/<some-path>/zaakpay/response/"
Though this can be changed in the Apache configuration by editing the WSGIScriptAlias.

Since this is a WSGI application, if you are using Apache as a server, you can use the mod_wsgi as an Apache module.
You can download the mod_wsgi from http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/downloads/list
Take care to download the one for your Python Installation version.

Configuring Apache & mod_WSGI:
Add the following into httpd.conf
=================================
LoadModule wsgi_module /path/to/modules/directory/mod_wsgi.so

<Directory "/absolute/path/to/zaakpay.wsgi-directory">
AddHandler wsgi-script .wsgi
Order deny,allow
Allow from all
</Directory>

WSGIScriptAlias /zaakpay "<absolute/path/to/zaakpay.wsgi>/"
